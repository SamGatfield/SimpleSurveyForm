# SimpleSurveyForm
A survey form made on freeCodeCamp, as an end of 'topic' project where i had to use the knowledge i had gained from the previous 3 tasks of,
builidng a Cat Photos Website with HTML, using CSS to experiment with colour styles and, making a registration form.
I got given what the form needed to have but not a set way, or step-by-step guide on how to do it.
